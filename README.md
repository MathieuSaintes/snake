# Pygame Snake

Command to launch the game: <code>python3 snake.py</code>

Eat the fruits to get more points, while avoiding the walls and the bombs<br>
Press the space key to pause the game

Every time a fruit is eaten:
- The snake grows
- The moving area shrinks
  
The yellow area shows the part of the moving area that will disappear when the next fruit is eaten<br>
Make sure the tail of your snake is not in the yellow area when eating the next fruit!
